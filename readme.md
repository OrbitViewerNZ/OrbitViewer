Orbit Viewer
=========================

Orbit Viewer is an interactive visualization tool used to view near earth objects (comets and asteroids) in relation to the planets. This project was started during the [2015 International Space Apps Challenge](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/).

The code base is a direct port of a Java Applet of the same name by Osamu Ajiki and Ron Baalke. You can find more about that project on [its home page](http://www.astroarts.com/products/OrbitViewer/index.html) and [its source code repo](https://github.com/TheOrbitals/OrbitViewerApplet). This applet is currently being used on NASA's website. You can see an example [here](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=6344%20P-L;orb=1). This new Orbit Viewer project aims to provide an alternative solution to the existing Orbit Viewer applet.

In the near term, this project will achieve feature parity with the original Orbit Viewer but using current web technologies (specifically the Canvas API). After that, it will add a number of features that make it an even better experience on the web such as being embedded in other pages and fullscreen support.

This readme will evolve as the more of the project is implemented. You can see the current progress by viewing the demo page.
